/* 
  This CSS file contains global styles for the Kelle Solutions website. It defines font sizes, responsive media queries,
  button focus styles, and layout settings for the HTML and body elements. Additionally, specific styling for the carousel 
  component has been added to reduce its vertical height while maintaining image proportions.

  Purpose:
  - Establish consistent font sizes across devices.
  - Provide default styles for buttons, form controls, and focus states.
  - Maintain the minimum height of the HTML body and reserve space for the footer.
  - Apply custom styling to the carousel component for better display.
